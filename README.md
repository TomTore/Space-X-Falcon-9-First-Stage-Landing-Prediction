## DS Capstone: Space X  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## Background & Context
SpaceX advertises each Falcon 9 launch at $62 million, whereas competing providers charge upwards of $165 million, largely due to their inability to reuse the first stage. By forecasting whether the booster will land successfully, the true cost of a given launch can be estimated in advance.
Such cost estimates are critical for any alternative launch provider seeking to submit competitive bids against SpaceX.

## Problems to Be Addressed
How can the safety advantages of coastal pad locations be quantified in terms of stage drop zones and booster recovery corridors over open sea?

What buffer distances from shoreline, major highways and rail lines—and what exclusion zones around populated areas—strike the optimal balance between logistical efficiency and public safety?

What relationships exist between payload mass, booster variant and landing outcome, and which combinations maximize touchdown reliability?

How accurately can machine-learning classifiers predict first-stage landing success when trained on a comprehensive set of mission parameters?
